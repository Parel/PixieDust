Provides important libraries for developing JavaScript games in the browser.

Defines the main PixieEngine GameObject and includes a variety of mixins to easily augment them with behaviors.

Mixins
  - Bounded: access the GameObject's bounding box. Useful to pass into collision code.
  - Drawable: provides a simple draw method to the including object.
  - Durable: cause GameObjects to be destroyed after a given duration.
  - Emitter / Emitterable: A parameterizable system for creating particles
  - Movable: Provides a basic position update according to velocity and acceleration. Best suited to things whose movement isn't very complex, like particles.
  - Rotatable: Rotate a GameObject based on a rotational velocity you define.

Common helper classes are included as well such as basic collisions, sprites, a drawing helper, and a particle system.
